# AI-Hello
Simple code to reading a handwritten digit number from any image by using Python AI libraries

First run below command to building neurones network for this model ONCE TIME:

"python3 neurones-model.py"

Then EVERYTIME that you want to read a digit from any image run below command:

"python3 predict.py"

Also "neurons-model" Linux executable file for arm64 devices is available at Releases section, After download simply run:

"./neurons-model"

In this case you do not need to installing Python compiler and its modules especially heavy AI "tensorflow" module.

Unfortunately, Because of some solutions single binary executable file is not available for "predict.py" currently. We solve it at the future!
